#Initial PRISM Simulation: 

The files that were given initially were supposed to run the following program when PRISM_Simulation file was run.

This program was supposed to put the value 8 in the accumulator, add one to the accumulator, and output this value with every iteration to output port three.  This continued until the value in the accumulator became negative. In this lab, however, it seems that the output of the program is not working correctly.  The value of the output is always shown as U in the simulation, not the value of the accumulator.
